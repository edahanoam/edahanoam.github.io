I'm Noam, I am a **research fellow** at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, working with [Dr. Abhilasha Ravichander](https://lasharavichander.github.io/). My research focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:  I care about how AI systems meet real people and real information, and I hope to build methods and evaluation practices that better reflect diverse users and use cases.

Before NLP, I spent over five years as a **journalist**: as a news editor at [Haaretz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haaretz) and earlier at GLZ Radio. So I really do love text (and thinking about its consequences!).

I completed my master’s in Computer Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem with [Dr. Gabriel Stanovsky](https://gabrielstanovsky.github.io/), where I worked on multilingual datasets and evaluation approaches in NLP (see [Publications](https://edahanoam.github.io/publications/) for more info:) ).

**I am seeking PhD opportunities in NLP groups, particularly around evaluation, factuality, and human-centered AI.**

I’m currently working on questions related to factuality and nuanced forms of misleading content, such as framing and omission. I'd love to connect if you're working on similar topics!
